# SHREW
Repo for the Software and Hardware Reverse Engineering Workshop (SHREW). 

## Virtual Machines
The following virtual machine images are set up with the requisite software for the workshop.
* [Kali 2024.2 x86-64]() - for use with Intel-based processors.
* [Kali 2024.2 ARM64](https://share.ialab.dsu.edu/CAE_Workshops/2024/SHREW/Kali-2024.2-ARM.zip) - for use with ARM-based processors (e.g., Apple M2)

### System Requirements
* Processor cores: 2
* Free disk space: 64 GB
* RAM: 4 GB
* USB-A 2.0/3.0 ports (or USB-C adapter)

## Binaries

The [binaries directory](https://github.com/dsu-cs/shrew-facdev/tree/main/binaries) has software reverse engineering exercises.

## Microbit
The [microbit directory](https://github.com/dsu-cs/shrew-facdev/tree/main/microbit) contains sample projects for building binaries written with C++ or the Arduino framework.
